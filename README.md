Uses this URL https://www.somewhere.com/shop/jsonApi/index.php which generates a JSON feed.

1. Reads the list of phones from the JSON object (using JavaScript)
2. All the boxes (blue and green) are filled with the phones from the JSON API
3. On hover or click the price and name is shown for the small boxes and for the big boxes the same information plus the subscription type of the phone.
4. Makes a dropdown list (e.g. the select phone from the jpg) with all the phones name that you get from the JSON feed 
5. Implements this user story: As a user when I select a phone from the select box, I want the selected phone from the list to be highlighted (example the black box from the image which is different than the rest)



Meets the requirements:


- IE9+ support
- Looks good also on small views (phones)
- Native JavaScript only (no JQuery or 3rd party libraries)
