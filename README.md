Assignment:

Using this URL https://www.somewhere.com/shop/jsonApi/index.php which generates a JSON feed we would like to:

1. Read the list of phones from the JSON object (using JavaScript)
2. All the boxes (blue and green) needs to be filled with the phones from the JSON API
3. On hover or click the price and name has to show for the small boxes and for the big boxes the same information plus the subscription type of the phone.
4. Makes a dropdown list (e.g. the select phone from the jpg) with all the phones name that you get from the JSON feed 
5. As a user when I select a phone from the select box, I want the selected phone from the list to be highlighted (example the black box from the image which is different than the rest)



Requirements for the app:

6. You can ignore strange devices from the JSON feed 
7. IE9+ support
8. It should look good also on small views (phones)
9. Feel free to write your html, CSS the way you like it (you can use bootstrap)
10. Native JavaScript only (no JQuery or 3rd party libraries)
11. The layout implementation doesnâ€™t have to be pixel perfect as the one from the image (feel free to add any visual improvements if you like)
